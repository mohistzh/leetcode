//Given a list accounts, each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where th
//e first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and the rest of the elements are email
//s representing emails of the account. 
//
// Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to
// the same person if there is some email that is common to both accounts. Note th
//at even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people 
//as people could have the same name. A person can have any number of accounts ini
//tially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name. 
//
// After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the 
//first element of each account is the name, and the rest of the elements are emai
//ls in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order. 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input: 
//accounts = [["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john00@mail.com"], ["John", "johnn
//ybravo@mail.com"], ["John", "johnsmith@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com"], ["Ma
//ry", "mary@mail.com"]]
//Output: [["John", 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.
//com'],  ["John", "johnnybravo@mail.com"], ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]]
//Explanation: 
//The first and third John's are the same person as they have the common email "
//johnsmith@mail.com".
//The second John and Mary are different people as none of their email addresses
// are used by other accounts.
//We could return these lists in any order, for example the answer [['Mary', 'ma
//ry@mail.com'], ['John', 'johnnybravo@mail.com'], 
//['John', 'john00@mail.com', 'john_newyork@mail.com', 'johnsmith@mail.com']] wo
//uld still be accepted.
// 
// 
//
// Note:
// The length of accounts will be in the range [1, 1000]. 
// The length of accounts[i] will be in the range [1, 10]. 
// The length of accounts[i][j] will be in the range [1, 30].
